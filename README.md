# CYCLEBAR TEST

This front end project is a CycleBar test.

I was sent a layout with specific font families to use - from Google and Typekit. I also recieved images to use for the project.

The guidelines were simple: mimic the layouts. Of the two layouts, one was for desktops or laptops. The other layout is for mobile.

I used the @mobil annotation to override the layouts for smaller screen widths.

I was given a week to "get as much done as I could".

As a designer, I inevitably travel down the rabbit hole of tweaking.

As a developer, sometimes things work (sometimes I know why and sometimes I don't!). And sometimes things don't work (same).

I would love to have gotten more done on this project and I will continue to work on it after the deadline has passed (3pm Wednesday Oct 18, 2017).
